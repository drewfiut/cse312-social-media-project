# cse312-social-media-project Repo
### Overview
You'll work in a team to create a social media site of your own design which includes:

* User Accounts
* Live sharing of multimedia content between users
* Users can "vote" and comment on user-submitted content
* Users can friend or follow other users
* Users can send direct messages to other users

### Weekly Meetings
All scheduled recitation sections are cancelled and replaced with team meetings which will start on week 5 of the semester. Your team will schedule a time and location for these meetings and all team members will submit the team meeting form after each meeting.

[Team Meeting Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBSSWEZfJaLPnq8Sya7A_OG9-CBNtU2_7UYNpEhxH4EnBdlQ/viewform)  
Meeting submissions and peer evaluations will be used to adjust individual grades at the discretion of the course staff. The average individual score for a team will equal the team score for each phase (ie. An entire team will not be penalized based on meetings and evaluations).

### Open-Source Reports
As opposed to the homework assignments, you are allowed to use external libraries, frameworks, and services for your project. For example, instead of building your site starting with a TCP socket server you can use technology such as Express, Flask, Django, React, Angular, Handlebars, Apache, Nginx, Socket.io, Heroku, AWS, Firebase, etc. Any time you use technology that was not developed by your team you must provide a report for that technology.

**Report:** For each technology used in your project your team must submit a technical report explaining what it accomplishes, how it works, and the licenses involved. In addition to the report, every team member who developed on the part of the project using a specific technology must be prepared to answer questions about it at all times (Especially during your presentation).

Each report must answer:

* What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
  * Explain what this technology does in your project. What problems does it solve for you?
* How does this technology accomplish what it does?
  * For each problem this technology solves for you, explain in detail how it solves it starting with a TCP socket connection. You must include links to any relevant documentation or code. If the technology is open-source, you must include links to the exact code that solves your problem for you.
  * Ex. If you use express for your web framework you must explain how express handles an HTTP request starting with a TCP connection to include how it routes requests, how headers are parsed, etc. and link to the exact code on GitHub that parses HTTP headers and routes paths. Any other express features used must also be explained and the code linked. You do not have to explain features that are not used in your project.
* What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?
  * When using technology you did not write you will be subject to certain agreements. List any licences attached to the project (Ex. MIT, Apache) and what that license means for your project. If using a service, review the terms of service and explain all the implications of these terms for your project.
  
**Why?:** Developing a website using existing frameworks/libraries/services does not require years of CSE education and is not appropriate for a project in a 300-level technical course. The use of frameworks/libraries/services are allowed for this project, and strongly encouraged outside of this course, but you must prove that you understand what is being done for you by other developers and how they do it. In this course, you cannot use technology that you do not understand.

A report must be included in your repository for each library/framework used in your project. If any reports are missing, inadequate, or a team member who developed with a technology fails to answer questions about it the is in violation and the project may become invalid. Consequence will be decided by the course staff on a case-by-case basis which can range up to a 0 for all 4 parts of the project (All 3 phases and the presentation).
