# projecthookup

### Overview

projecthookup is an online social media that allows it's users to see and join projects that they're interested in.  These can be any kind of project or work that requires collaboration with a team.  A user will post a project they're interested in starting, or need help with, and other users can like and join the project.  

### Our Goal

We wanted to make a platform that inspires collaboration and teamwork to create amazing products.  As the saying goes, "two heads are better than one" and we set out to make finding those two (or more) heads easier than ever with our application.  Our users are able to find teammates that have the necessary skills to complete the projects they post.  When a user joins a project, they will be included in that project until the project is closed or they leave the project.  Each project will have a discussion board, or comments section where a dicussion can happen about the project for interested users.  Also, there will be direct messages between users so that more private conversations can happen between teammates.
