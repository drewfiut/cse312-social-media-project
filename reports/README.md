# projecthookup

### Overview

projecthookup is an online social media that allows it's users to see and join projects that they're interested in.  These can be any kind of project or work that requires collaboration with a team.  A user will post a project they're interested in starting, or need help with, and other users can like and join the project.

* What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
  * Explain what this technology does in your project. What problems does it solve for you?
* How does this technology accomplish what it does?
  * For each problem this technology solves for you, explain in detail how it solves it starting with a TCP socket connection. You must include links to any relevant documentation or code. If the technology is open-source, you must include links to the exact code that solves your problem for you.
  * Ex. If you use express for your web framework you must explain how express handles an HTTP request starting with a TCP connection to include how it routes requests, how headers are parsed, etc. and link to the exact code on GitHub that parses HTTP headers and routes paths. Any other express features used must also be explained and the code linked. You do not have to explain features that are not used in your project.
* What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?
  * When using technology you did not write you will be subject to certain agreements. List any licences attached to the project (Ex. MIT, Apache) and what that license means for your project. If using a service, review the terms of service and explain all the implications of these terms for your project.

**Why?:** Developing a website using existing frameworks/libraries/services does not require years of CSE education and is not appropriate for a project in a 300-level technical course. The use of frameworks/libraries/services are allowed for this project, and strongly encouraged outside of this course, but you must prove that you understand what is being done for you by other developers and how they do it. In this course, you cannot use technology that you do not understand.

A report must be included in your repository for each library/framework used in your project. If any reports are missing, inadequate, or a team member who developed with a technology fails to answer questions about it the is in violation and the project may become invalid. Consequence will be decided by the course staff on a case-by-case basis which can range up to a 0 for all 4 parts of the project (All 3 phases and the presentation).

### Our Goal

We wanted to make a platform that inspires collaboration and teamwork to create amazing products.  As the saying goes, "two heads are better than one" and we set out to make finding those two (or more) heads easier than ever with our application.  Our users are able to find teammates that have the necessary skills to complete the projects they post.  When a user joins a project, they will be included in that project until the project is closed or they leave the project.  Each project will have a discussion board, or comments section where a dicussion can happen about the project for interested users.  Also, there will be direct messages between users so that more private conversations can happen between teammates.
