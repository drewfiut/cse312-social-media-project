# Our Use
We utilize Wt-Forms StringField, PasswordField, SubmitField, BooleanField, SelectField, IntegerField, and TextAreaField.
These fields allow us to have and handle different types of form inputs. 

From WT-Froms.Validators we use DataRequired, Length, Email, and EqualTo. These help us check the input in our form to ensure they are the filled the right length right type or right value.
